            <h1>NEWS</h1>
                <h2>ASK MOJANG ANYTHING (AMA): <br>MINECRAFT LIVE 2022</h2>
                <p>Last Friday, we held our first AMA on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/">r/Minecraft</a>, where four members of <br>Mojang Studios answered community questions about the awesome things <br>we revealed at Minecraft Live 2022. In case you were curious about what <br>fun things were shared, we’ve got you covered! You can find a recap here.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="b"><b>Aside from the Deep Dark, what was a feature that went through lots of <br>different iterations/reworks?</b></p>
                <br>
            	<p><b>N, Bedrock Developer:</b> Piglin was surprisingly the mob that has the most <br>iterations with quite a lot of mechanics being added in each iteration. Did <br>you know that piglins have a small chance of doing a celebration dance if <br>they win the war over hoglin? Or that if the number of hoglins are more than <br>the number of piglins, the hoglins will start chasing the piglins instead?</p>
                <br>
                <p class="b">What's a feature that was a tiny change from a player's perspective, <br>but was extremely difficult to implement?</p>
                <br>
                <p>N: Local water levels inside cave systems may seem really simple to a <br>player, but it was super complex to get it right. There were a lot of tweaks <br>we had to make to get the right amount of water and we also had to devote <br>quite a lot of time to fix the perf impact since it's something that each block <br>has to calculate.</p>

                <p>One of the cutest announcements at this year’s Minecraft Live was the <br>addition of camels to the game! There were lots of specific questions about <br>the upcoming mob and how their functionality may differ from the existing ridable mobs. </p>
